        <p><b>[2-3-25] -</b> Happy first school day in February!<p/>
        <p><b>[1-15-25] -</b> We are starting to prepare our MPA pieces! Wish us luck!</p>
        <p><b>[12-19-24] -</b> Sorry about the lack of updates, my computer (school and personal) broke down, so it's been a while. Anyways, PRISM concert was AWESOME, and I hope you enjoyed! Christmas break is almost here, so I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a happy new year! (cliche).
        <p><b>[12-9-24] -</b> PRISM CONCERT ON DECEMBER 12TH AND 13TH LETS GOO</p>
        <p><b>[12-4-24] -</b> Thank you to all that came to our Teddy Bear Concert! It was very fun though unusually intensive this year due to setbacks we endured at the beginning of the year. Unfortunately for I (the writer), this will be my last concert, but no worries, the orchestra will continue this long standing tradition! We hope you all enjoyed and again thank you for attending! We will see you in about a week for the PRISM concert!</p>
        <p><b>[12-3-24] -</b> Hey everyone! I'm here to announce that our Teddy Bears' Concert is tommorow on Wednesday, December 4! Price of admission is FREE! Come join and have some festive fun, and don't forget a teddy bear! Or any plush for that matter.</p>
        <p><b>[12-1-24] -</b> Hope y'all had a good Thanksgiving break cause' schools coming back up. On the plus side, it's winter time! That means christmas (or any other holidays) and winter break soon! Remember that the Teddy Bears' Concert will be on December 4. Bring a teddy bear on concert day and have fun! Hopefully I can get that piano stuff down by then. MPA season will also be starting soon so yeah, lock in. Peace!</p>
        <p><b>[11-22-24] -</b> Hello everyone! We are going on Thanksgiving Break. We will be back to our usual activity after the break. Expect our <b>Teddy Bears' Picnic</b> and <b>PRISM</b> concerts! We are excited to perform soon! See y'all!</b><p/>
        <p><b>[11-21-24] -</b> Hello everyone! The CCHS Orchestra website is now in a functional state and can be used. We (and by that I mean I, with help from my peers) will try to keep this up to date and managable. Soon enough, this post will be edited to include a Google Form that will allow users to report any bugs or make any suggestions for updates and features. <b>For Leadership:</b> You know who I am, if you want me to add specifics or update certain metadata, just talk to me.</p>
