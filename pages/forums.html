        <p>When I look out of the window, I see outside. I see the thing that our ancestors know all too well, yet people don't even touch on a frequent basis anymore- grass. Like how do you even stop touching grass? Go outside bro, you done too much if you don't know what grass be feeling like anymore. Like you even smell like rotting doritos, and I don't even know if doritos can rot or not. Oh hey, that rhymes! Do you think tongue twisters exist in different languages or can even be tongue twisters in multiple languages? With translation of course. Honestly, before multiligual people, how did people of completely different lands and languages learn to speak each other's language, if there was no main language of instruction? That's a little baffling but I guess it worked.</p>
