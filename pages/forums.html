        <p>When I look out of the window, I see outside. I see the thing that our ancestors know all too well, yet people don't even touch on a frequent basis anymore- grass. Like how do you even stop touching grass? Go outside bro, you done too much if you don't know what grass be feeling like anymore. Like you even smell like rotting doritos, and I don't even know if doritos can rot or not. Oh hey, that rhymes! Do you think tongue twisters exist in different languages or can even be tongue twisters in multiple languages? With translation of course. Honestly, before multiligual people, how did people of completely different lands and languages learn to speak each other's language, if there was no main language of instruction? That's a little baffling but I guess it worked. Still though, I think that's crazy. Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room- a rubber room. A rubber room full of RATs- and rats make me crazy. Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a crib- a corn crib. A corn crib full of RATS- and rats make me crazy. Reminds me of the one tim where i made a text file that had almost a billion lines of just "Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room- a rubber room. A rubber room full of RATS- and rats make me crazy" and it took nearly several minutes too open. It got to the point where it really could not open in a reasonable time, so yeah, file is dead as hell. I think the file's size was something like more than a hundred megabytes? If you didn't know, that's actually crazy for a text file. Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room- a rubber room. A rubber room full of RATS- and rats make me crazy. Like most applications are hundreds of megabytes, or gigabytes as well, but I guess sometimes a lot of it is just bloatware, which is annoying cause' I need mah PC space bro. Speaking of space, I think space- like outer space is cool. Look at all the stars, the planets and stuff. The galaxies and nebulae look so pretty with all their colors amongst the black background of space with those little specks of light from stars as... I guess decoration? I kinda just forgot the word I was about to use. And to think all those stars are millions to even billions of years old, illuminating the abyssal void that is outer space.</p>
