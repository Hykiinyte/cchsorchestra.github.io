        <p>When I look out of the window, I see outside. I see the thing that our ancestors know all too well, yet people don't even touch on a frequent basis anymore- grass. Like how do you even stop touching grass? Go outside bro, you done too much if you don't know what grass be feeling like anymore. Like you even smell like rotting doritos, and I don't even know if doritos can rot or not. Oh hey, that rhymes! Do you think tongue twisters exist in different languages or can even be tongue twisters in multiple languages? With translation of course. Honestly, before multiligual people, how did people of completely different lands and languages learn to speak each other's language, if there was no main language of instruction? That's a little baffling but I guess it worked. Still though, I think that's crazy. Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room- a rubber room. A rubber room full of RATS- and rats make me crazy. Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a crib- a corn crib. A corn crib full of RATS- and rats make me crazy. Reminds me of the one time where I made a text file that had almost a billion lines of just "Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room- a rubber room. A rubber room full of RATS- and rats make me crazy" and it took nearly several minutes to open. It got to the point where it really could not open in a reasonable time, so yeah, file is dead as hell. I think the file's size was something like more than a hundred megabytes? If you didn't know, that's actually crazy for a text file. Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room- a rubber room. A rubber room full of RATS- and rats make me crazy. Like most applications are hundreds of megabytes, or gigabytes as well, but I guess sometimes a lot of it is just bloatware, which is annoying cause' I need mah PC space bro. Speaking of space, I think space- like outer space is cool. Look at all the stars, the planets and stuff. The galaxies and nebulae look so pretty with all their colors amongst the black background of space with those little specks of light from stars as... I guess decoration? I kinda just forgot the word I was about to use. And to think all those stars are millions to even billions of years old, illuminating the abyssal void that is outer space. From space you can view the Earth, in all it's modern day glory. Seeing the clouds and the Moon amongst the black background of outer space and the Sun the black sky must be so surreal, to see the massiveness of space all put to perspective when all of humanity is effectively sitting on a dust particle in space, orbiting a tiny firefly amongst much bigger behemoths for stars or even going crazy with black holes, the truly massive bodies and vacuums of space. TON 618 would be as large as three- that's right, THREE whole Pluto orbit solar systems placed side to side! Even then I specify Pluto orbit because the Solar System isn't just all that. It's all that and so much more. See for example the Kuiper Belt, and the oort Cloud, which go so far out- the Solar System to it's farthest extent may even be in magnitudes of whole light years! That's just crazy. Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room- a rubber room. A rubber room full of RATS- and rats make me crazy.</p>
        <p>And I tell them I'm fine, I'm fine, because that's what they want to hear. That's what I think they want to hear at least. I don't want help, because then they will get too close for my own comfort. But here the definition of what is comfortable is obscure. When I sit down at home, I feel like I'm in debt to something, but I have almost nothing left to give. When I sit down at school, I feel like I'm in some sort of prison that tries it's best to "comfort" me and raise me in everyone's best interest, yet we all know it's still a prison, and it hurts. But I'm fine, and I tell them I'm fine, because I'm fine. They don't need to hear the pain that I feel, because they can't stop for me even if they wanted too. A society is built to weed out people, not help foster those that are simply a little slow to prosper. Because I'm fine, just a little slow, and uninteresting in those things they fucking force me to do despite a clear and sincere lack of interest, as well as these topics not being immidiately or ever needed in a normal society or practical sense, unless I study them in a place such as college, which I wont. And yet I'm forced, but I'm fine. They want to see the things I do at home and are interested too, I want to show them but because of the fucking requirements of such a primary institution, there is no time to foster those skills and topics I likely want to pursue in a place like college. But I'm fine with that. I'm fine, because everyone else seems to be fine. And then I look at the finer detail and everyone else is not fine, but they say they're fine. They will just study at home. They're fine. I'm fine. This isn't some dumb shit from a book, I'm just saying I'm fine, because sometimes it looks like I'm broken, but I'm really not. I'm fine. I think. Sometimes I still feel the slit that was on my wrist 2 years ago, even though the wound has been long healed. Sometimes I wonder if it should have been deeper, or if there should've been more, but even though I'm fine, I'm genuinely happy that it was never physically severe. Though no one realizes that my life is still not safe regardless of how I feel. No one knows that I'm chronically(?) ill. No one knows if there is a cure for me besides patience. But I can only be patient for so long, 9 years of patience is already the worth of my child years. I'm fine. All the stress is so impactful on my everyday being, sometimes I can't think. Sometimes I can't breathe. Sometimes I don't feel. I'm fine though, because that's what they want. That's what I want too. Thank you for being friends.</p>
