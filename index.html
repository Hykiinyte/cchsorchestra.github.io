        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! Welcome to the Cypress Creek Orchestra website. Along with
          Florida's own Cypress Creek High School came our orchestra program,
          teaching the art of music and raising talented string instrumentalists.
          For the past 20 years, Cypress Creek's orchestra program has been led
          by our teacher Jimmy Gilliam, who has been responsible for preparing
          generations of students to create iconic performances.
        </p>
